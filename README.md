# The Dublin School of Drums (MS1 Project - Code Institute - Aaron Harbourne)
This is a website to promote an imaginary business called The Dublin School of Drums. It is intended to provide all relevant information to potential clients including 
the schools history, list of facilities, teachers list, student feedback and all contact information. Included in this project is a page called Lessons. This is a 
page with four instructional videos divided into two categories. The idea of this is to provide a sample to potential clients of a 
larger, regularly updated page that they would be given access to upon enrolment. The lessons page presented in this project is therefore a 
smaller sample page with four videos and two categories that would be expanded upon in both number of videos and categories in a larger
page requiring a sign in name and password. (Only the sample page is presented in this project).

## User Experience
User Stories:


1. First Time Visitor Goals:
* As a first time visitor I want to find all relevant information on the school. This includes facilities, location, teachers biographies,
lesson content and contact information (i.e email, phone number and social media links).
* As a first time visitor I want to read positive feedback from past pupils and read about how attending the school has benefitted
their playing. 
* As a first time visitor I want a way to contact the school to either get more information or to be sent enrolment forms.
* As a first time visitor I am interested in any features of the website that are unique to the school such as in this case, the lessons page
which is exclusive to enrolled students (Sample of this page presented in this project).

2. Returning Visitor Goals:
* As a returning visitor I want to access exclusive content on the site provided to me upon enrolment, in this case it is exclusive content
on the lessons page which is exclusive to enrolled students.
* As a returning visitor I want access to past recordings of the teachers, presented here in the clickable profile pictures in the teachers.html
page and linking to youtube videos of them playing.
* As a returning visitor I want access to social media to view updates at the school.

## Testing

* The Contact Us button on the index.html page brings the user straight to the Contact page bypassing the rest of the site. This page opens up
in the same tab as the Contact page is on the same website.
* The Carousel slide on the index.html page moves to the next image and comment automatically. It also has arrows that the user can click
to see the next image/comment to the left or right faster.
* The email address when clicked opens up users email site in a new tab.
* The social media links when clicked, open up in a new tab so user does not forget the site they left.
* On teachers.html each of the five images when clicked links to a youtube video in a new tab.
* Each of the images on teachers.html when hovered on displays a new image of that teacher so that the potential client can see them 
performing.
* on lessons.html, the Sign In button opens up a modal which effectively keeps the users attention by darkening the rest of the page.
* This modal allows the user to sign in for exclusive content. If the user fails to insert an @ into the email address and presses the Sign In
button, an alert will inform them that they must use the @ symbol in order to be able to sign in and will not allow the sign in until this
symbol is included.
* Each of the four videos on the lessons.html page will play when the user clicks on them and pause when clicked on again. Also all
four videos can be watched from whatever part the user wishes by dragging the dot on the red band to the desired time location.
* On the contact.html page the the Submit button will only submit the form if the email address has the @ symbol in it.
* The embedded Google map on the contact.html page can be zoomed in and out of as the user may need by using the plus and minus symbols on the lower righthand corner. Also a street view can be accessed
by clicking on the square in the lower left corner for the user to see the building as it looks in reality. If the user wishes
they can click on the link title 'see larger map' which will open up a larger view of the map in a new tab if they find the map presented
on the Contact page unreadable.
