# The Dublin School of Drums (MS1 Project - Code Institute - Aaron Harbourne)
This is a website to promote an imaginary business called The Dublin School of Drums. It is intended to provide all relevant information to potential clients including 
the schools history, list of facilities, teachers list, student feedback and all contact information. Included in this project is a page called Lessons. This is a 
page with four instructional videos divided into two categories. The idea of this is to provide a sample to potential clients of a 
larger, regularly updated page that they would be given access to upon enrolment. The lessons page presented in this project is therefore a 
smaller sample page with four videos and two categories that would be expanded upon in both number of videos and categories in a larger
page requiring a sign in name and password. (Only the sample page is presented in this project).
