# The Dublin School of Drums (MS1 Project - Code Institute - Aaron Harbourne)
This is a website to promote The Dublin School of Drums. It is intended to provide all relevant information to potential clients including 
the schools history, list of facilities, staff list and all contact information. Included in this project is a page called Lessons. This is a 
page with four instructional videos divided into two categories. The idea of this is to provide a sample to potential clients of a 
larger, regularly updated page that they will be given access to upon enrolment (Only the sample page is presented in this project and not the 
larger one intended for enrolled students). What sets this apart from YouTube videos with similar
content is that they are accessible only to enrolled students and they are relevant to material covered in one on one classes. Thus they 
are intended to reinforce learning from in person classes.
